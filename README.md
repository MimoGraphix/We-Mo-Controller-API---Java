We-Mo-Controller-API---Java
===========================

Hi all,

I was create a library for controlling WeMo Switch from computer.

*Example:*
```scala
  WeMoController wemo = new WeMoController( _IP_ );
  wemo.On();
```
  
You must have an IP of WeMo Switch but you can get it by UPnP protocol ar you will see it in your DHCP server.


In my repository is a PHP version too.
